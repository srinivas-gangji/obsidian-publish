## It’s not what you think
It’s 7 pm on a Sunday.

I’ve just finished 6 hours of painting, sanding, filling, mixing cement, and bleaching ceilings (don’t ask). That was Sunday. Saturday was much the same, Friday was work then renovations. Thursday was work then 2 hours of travelling (2.5 hours) quick bite to eat. Bed.

That’s been life lately. Up at 6 am (when I can manage it), write, work, renovate, eat, bed. Over and over. And I wish the house things would take much less time. As much as I might like it to take 3 minutes to remove tile adhesive from the floor, it takes 3 hours. Hours of chipping, sweeping, chipping, sweeping.

That’s where I was last week, 5:30 pm on a Wednesday (or was it Tuesday?) chipping tile adhesive off the floor because I’m new to this renovation life and didn’t realise that you screed a floor before putting a skirting board down. _Eurgh._ So ensued the last-minute panic and 3 hours of chiselling (with occasional arm shaking to return the blood back to my forearm).

Having managed to avert the disaster of the screed bleeding into the skirting board, still, there was a weekend full of things to do (of course). A never-ending list somehow. One thing gets fixed, another breaks. It’s this over and over.

Only 5 weeks left I tell myself.

But that doesn’t stop my eyes from burning in the morning as they’re hit by the bright white light of the screen. It means I need a 3rd cup of coffee before 9 am. It means the corner of page 123 is still folded over, the book that’s sat on my desk for the last 3 weeks.

It’s this relentlessness, these waves of enduring, this seemingly endless road that you must learn to walk, to pursue, to, gulp, enjoy. Because this road, is the road. And that's exactly what it’s like writing on the internet.

# Rewind

Three years ago I started writing on the internet, I’ve always been juggling stuff, back then it was a full-time job, writing on the internet and an MSc. Today it’s two jobs, writing on the internet (which has turned into a business) and renovating a 1940s house in the country (that’s 100 miles away from where I actually live).

_At this point, I yawn every 20 minutes._

If you zoom into my journey with writing, it’s much like every other worthwhile pursuit, my MSc, the house renovation, and training my dogs.

It’s a shedload of work but that, weirdly, makes it worthwhile.

It’s these early mornings, this achy back, this constant yawning, the book that’s left unread, all are signs of the sacrifice, of the work, of the ‘stuff’ it takes.

It’s why when I hit my first 10,000 subscribers on my newsletter I felt good, really good. When I made six figures last year I felt an overwhelming sense of pride. When I finally finish my house, I’ll likely cry.

Because of the work, not despite it.

# If there is any unfair advantage it’s this

If you are able to count up all the things. All the long nights, the sacrifices, the time, the worry. All of those things, if you can package them up and reframe your struggle as the price, you shed a new light on your work.

I kept writing on the internet because I knew it would take years, I wasn’t in a rush, and I loved the pursuit. I fell in love with the struggle. I came to expect the lows. I knew things would crawl.

I was okay with it.

I saw it as the price to be paid.

The expectation that it will be easy, that there’s little effort or a short time to be endured to get where you want to go is the thing that derails most people.

==My rule of thumb for anything worth doing is the same rule to be true of my renovation:== ==**it takes twice as long and costs twice as much.**==

With any personal development pursuit, you pay in effort. And it’s a price worth paying.
