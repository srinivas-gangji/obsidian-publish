## Sometimes, wisdom appears [only] when we are ready.

I went back to my parent’s apartment last Friday.

I was tired, bitter, and a tad too emotional.

_“What am I still so broke? Sigh.”_

I thought, _I thought_, that was me talking to myself. You know that infamous inner voice thing? I was wrong. Mum heard it.

She walked towards me and put her hands over my shoulders.

I looked at her as if I was a puppy desperate for cookies.

Mum gave none. Instead, she dropped a wisdom bomb.

# **“Shouldn’t You Know the Answer? You Tried Too Hard.”**

I was stumped.

You know, like the turkey in the frozen section of Cold Storage.

Like, I wasn’t expecting Mum to say that. Mum’s mantra in life is simple. She doesn’t get bothered with what I do. She leads her own life. I lead mine.

This is her only direct concern when it comes to me.

_“Remember to transfer money to the household account this Friday.”_

That is it.

She has never interfered with my entrepreneurial side of life, the online writing hustle, or how much progress my private businesses have achieved. Mum understands none of that.

_“How is your job? Are you meeting your sales target? Are you getting retrenched?”_

These are her concerns each time we meet.

In truth, it hurts. _Sort of_.

- ==She had zero interest in my life pursuits, no matter my progress or achievements.==
- I have little interest in my 9–6 beyond paying the bills, and that was her primary concern.

We were 2 parallel lines that never met.

It was hard.

And I never understood why.

Today, I did.

It turns out that wisdom knocks on the doors of the ready. At 40, I am.

# **“Why Do You Mean, Mum? Isn’t Life About Trying Hard and Giving Our All?”**

That Aldric at 27, 32, or 37 would have retaliated verbally.

Today? No longer. I found courage in calmness.

I engage. I probed.

Mum smiled.

She was gentle with her words and harsh with her tone.

_“Look at Yan. Your baby cousin became a quiet millionaire at 37. Did she start a business and go hustle? No. All she did was focus on her job. Look at her today. She made it. And she got what_ **_you_** _wanted.”_

I was speechless.

There is nothing to argue against. Mum is right on all accounts. The problem is me. I never had the heart and mature mind to listen.

I always thought she was disconnected from the real world. It was a mistake. A bad one.

I’m embarrassed.

_“Yes, you are right, Mum. But she is one of the rare few who made it with her day job. Many others never did and will never do.”_

She looked at me like I was the stupidest kid she had ever encountered. I guess I was.

_“Son. That’s true. But are you one of those struggling at work and in life? Are you earning $2 per hour? Do you have a manual labor job? No, right?”_

Again.

Mum is right.

Darn it.

# **“You Left The Stable Path to Do Your Own Thing. Pay the Price.”**

This image came to me when Mum said the above.

I watched her walk towards me with a kitchen knife, stab me in my heart, drive it in once, twice, thrice, and then leave the weapon there.

I was bleeding, in acute pain, and whining.

The best part? I allowed her to. I had no defense. For the first time in years, Mum got me. She chewed me alive.

_“Understand this, son. You could have been promoted to Senior Manager at your first consulting firm 7 years ago. If you did, you could have made what Yan is making today. You walked away. You are_ **_THAT~_** _close.”_

Sigh.

_So smart yet so stupid_, my inner voice muttered.

My Aunt would echo that.

Mum wasn’t done.

_“Make sure you don’t make that mistake again. Pursuit your goals. Achieve them. Become filthy rich. Prove that you are right all this while and that I am wrong. I will be proud of you. Quit whining. Go eat your dinner.”_

My head felt heavy. I dropped it.

Mum saw that. She said the following.

_“Come, let’s have dinner now. Eat so you have the energy to work. Otherwise, how are you going to be a millionaire? You are already late. Don’t delay it.”_

I was touched for a while.

Like 2 minutes.

**_I was_**.

Until I heard this.

_“You haven’t transferred the household allowance to me, you broke rat. I am waiting!”_

Right.

I see.

# **The Close**

Is Mum wicked? Maybe.

She waited 7 years to tell me the harsh truth of life I needed to hear.

Is Mum profound? I think so.

She knew I was close to my baby cousin, and Yan achieved my goals at 37. If I stuck with my guns, bit the bullet, and forge ahead, I would. _Maybe_. But I chose not to.

And this is the problem. I chose to walk this path.

I should not whine about being broke.

It’s my wretched choice.

And I think my Mum is wickedly profound because…

… She made me realize one thing.

That I ought to eat my own sh!t.
